# Arduino-IR-Using-Java

Okay, so this personal project that I use every day it's about controlling the two LEDs (not smart LEDs, remote-controlled) in my room from my PC with an App.
The App is built using java and it sends a control signal (bytes xD) to the Arduino that is connected to my pc
the Arduino then acts upon those signals to turn off, on or change the colors the LEDs.
the AHK script helps me lock my PC and turn off the monitors. I also have a sensor connected to the Arduino so when I leave my room and come back it automaticly turn on the LEDs and the pc
